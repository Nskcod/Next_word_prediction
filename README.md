Next Word Prediction with Deep Learning in NLP

Overview
This project focuses on building a Next Word Prediction model using Deep Learning techniques in Natural Language Processing (NLP). The goal is to create a model that predicts the next word in a sentence based on the context provided by the preceding words.

Features
Text Preprocessing: Tokenization, padding, and encoding of text data.
Deep Learning Model: Utilizes LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) or GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) networks for sequence prediction.
Training and Evaluation: Model training with appropriate metrics and evaluation for accuracy and performance.
Prediction Interface: User-friendly interface to input text and receive next word predictions.

Requirements
Python 3.x
TensorFlow or Keras
Numpy
Pandas
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib
NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) or similar libraries for text processing

Installation

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/next-word-prediction.git

Navigate to the project directory:
cd next-word-prediction

Install the required Python packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt


Usage
Prepare Your Data: Place your text corpus in the data/ directory. The data should be cleaned and preprocessed.

Train the Model: Run the training script to train the model with your data.
python train.py

Predict Next Word: Use the prediction script to test the model and get next word predictions.
python predict.py --text "Your input text here"

Evaluate the Model: Check the evaluation results to assess model performance.

Directory Structure
data/: Contains the dataset and preprocessed data files.
models/: Stores trained model files.
scripts/: Includes scripts for training, prediction, and evaluation.
requirements.txt: Lists the required Python packages.
